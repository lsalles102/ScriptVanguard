    question_1: "Is FovDark safe to use? Will I get banned?",
    answer_1: "FovDark is designed with security as our top priority. We use advanced anti-detection technology that bypasses Blood Strike's anti-cheat mechanisms. Our products are regularly updated to maintain compatibility with game patches. While no cheat can guarantee 100% safety, our detection rate is among the lowest in the industry, and we offer security guidelines to further minimize risk.",
    question_2: "How does the HWID lock system work?",
    answer_2: "Hardware ID (HWID) locking is a security measure that ties your subscription to your specific computer. When you first activate FovDark, the software will generate a unique identifier based on your hardware components. Your subscription will only work on this computer. If you need to change computers, you'll need to contact support for a HWID reset, which is available once every 30 days.",
    question_3: "Do you offer refunds if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer_3: "We offer a 24-hour money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with your purchase and have not violated our terms of service. To request a refund, contact our support team with your order number and reason for dissatisfaction. Please note that refunds are not available if your account has been banned due to improper use of our products or if you've used the product for more than 24 hours.",
    question_4: "How often do you update your products?",
    answer_4: "We release updates on a regular schedule, usually weekly for minor fixes and monthly for major feature updates. However, if the game receives a significant update or patch, we prioritize compatibility updates and typically release them within 24-48 hours. All updates are automatically applied through our loader program when you launch it, ensuring you always have the latest version.",
    question_5: "Will FovDark work with other games?",
    answer_5: "Currently, FovDark is primarily designed for Blood Strike and its variants. However, we are continuously expanding our product line to include more games. Check our website regularly for announcements about new game support. If you're interested in a specific game, you can submit a request through our support system, and we'll consider it for future development."
